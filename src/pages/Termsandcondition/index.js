          discovering and accessing JeevaJoy content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations

          1.1. Your JeevaJoy membership will continue until terminated. To use the JeevaJoy service you must have
          Internet access and a JeevaJoy ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment
          Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and
          which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership
          before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to
          your Payment Method (see “Cancellation” below). <br /><br />
          1.2. We may offer a number of subscription plans, including subscription plans that contain commercial
          breaks and other types of commercial messages (“Advertisements”). Please note that our subscription
          plans without Advertisements may still contain limited commercial content, such as branded content or
          sponsorship messaging. In addition, we may give our users the opportunity to watch live or special
          events (including replays of such content) or to enjoy new additional features. Such content and new
          features may contain Advertisements independent of your subscription plan. <br /><br />
          1.3. Some subscriptions are offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own
          products and services. In addition, some subscription plans may have differing conditions and
          limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.
          You can find specific details regarding your JeevaJoy subscription by visiting the JeevaJoy.com website
          and clicking on the “Account” link available at the top of the pages under your profile name. <br /><br />
          Promotional Offers. We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans, or memberships
          (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by JeevaJoy at its sole discretion and we reserve the right
          to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible.
          Members of households with an existing or recent JeevaJoy membership may not be eligible for certain
          introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment, or an account email
          address used with an existing or recent JeevaJoy membership to determine Offer eligibility. The
          eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the
          Offer or in other communications made available to you.

        <h6>
          3.1. Billing Cycle. The subscription fee for the JeevaJoy service will be charged to your Payment Method
          on the specific payment date indicated on the “Account” page. The length of your billing cycle will
          depend on the type of subscription plan that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some
          cases, your payment date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled,
          when you change your subscription plan or if your paid subscription began on a day not contained in a
          given month. Visit the JeevaJoy.com website and click on the “Billing details” link on the “Account”
          page to see your next payment date. If you signed up for JeevaJoy using your account with a third party
          as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your JeevaJoy subscription by visiting
          your account with the applicable third party. <br /><br />
          3.2. Payment Methods. To use the JeevaJoy service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You
          authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method
          is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible
          for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient
          funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until
          we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you
          certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment
          Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method
          service provider for details. <br /><br />
          3.3. Updating your Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the “Account” page.
          We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers.
          Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). <br /><br />
          3.4. Cancellation. You can cancel your JeevaJoy membership at any time, and you will continue to have
          access to the JeevaJoy service through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable and
          we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused JeevaJoy content. To
          cancel, go to the “Account” page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your
          membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when
          your account will close, click “Billing details” on the “Account” page. If you signed up for JeevaJoy
          using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your JeevaJoy membership,
          you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable
          third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the JeevaJoy service through that third
          party. <br /><br />
          3.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and the price of
          our service from time to time. We will notify you at least one month before any price changes or changes
          to your subscription plan will become effective. If you do not wish to accept the price change or change
          to your subscription plan, you can cancel your membership before the change takes effect.

          non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household unless otherwise
          allowed by your subscription plan. During your JeevaJoy membership, we grant you a limited,

          content. The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time to
          time. Not all JeevaJoy content may be available in the ad-supported subscription plan. The number of
          devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified
          on the “Account” page. <br /><br />
          4.4. The JeevaJoy service, including the content library, is regularly updated. In addition, we

          features. You can turn off test participation at any time by visiting the “Account” page and changing
          the “Test participation” settings. <br /><br />
          4.5. Depending on your subscription plan, some JeevaJoy content may be available for temporary download
          and offline viewing on certain supported devices (“Offline Titles”). Limitations apply, including
          restrictions on the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain
          Offline Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long
          the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Some Offline Titles may not be playable in certain countries
          and if you go online in a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline Title, the Offline
          Title will not be playable while you are in that country. <br /><br />
          4.6. Except as explicitly authorized by us, you agree not to: <br /><br />
          (i) archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works
          from, offer for sale, or use content and information contained on or obtained from or through the
          JeevaJoy service; <br /><br />
          (ii) circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, block, obscure or thwart any of the content

          with the JeevaJoy service, including any software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs <br /><br />
          We may terminate or restrict your use of our service if you violate these Terms of Use or are engaged in
          illegal or fraudulent use of the service. <br /><br />
          4.7. The quality of the display of the JeevaJoy content may vary from device to device, and may be
          affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of
          your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD, and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and
          device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as HD, Ultra HD, and HDR, and not
          all subscription plans allow you to receive content in all formats. The minimum connection speed for HD
          video quality (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher) is 3.0 Mbps per stream; however, we recommend
          a faster connection for improved video quality. A connection speed of at least 5.0 Mbps per stream is
          recommended to receive Full HD video quality (defined as a resolution of 1080p or higher). A connection
          speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD video quality (defined as a
          resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with your
          Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin
          watching JeevaJoy content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available
          bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected, and the configuration of your JeevaJoy ready
          device. <br /><br />
          4.8. JeevaJoy software is developed by, or for, JeevaJoy and may solely be used for authorized streaming
          and to access JeevaJoy content through JeevaJoy ready devices. This software may vary by device and
          medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between devices. You acknowledge that the use
          of the service may require third-party software that is subject to third-party licenses. You agree that
          you may automatically receive updated versions of the JeevaJoy software and related third-party
          software. <br /><br />
          Passwords and Account Access. Your password is for your personal use only and should be kept
          confidential. If you allow others to access the account (which includes access to information on viewing
          activity for the account), you agree that such individuals are acting on your behalf and that you are
          bound by any changes that they may make to the account, including but not limited to changes to the
          subscription plan. To help maintain control over the account and to prevent any unauthorized users from
          accessing the account, you should maintain control over the devices that are used to access the service
          and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You
          agree to provide and maintain accurate information relating to your account, including a valid email
          address so we can send you account-related notices. We can terminate your account or place your account
          on hold in order to protect you, JeevaJoy or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent
          activity.
